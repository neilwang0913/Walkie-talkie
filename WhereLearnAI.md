Coursera is an online learning platform that provides classes in a large number of subjects. I suggest the introductory course on machine learning taught by Andrew Ng, a computer science adjunct professor at Stanford.
EdX, another online platform, offers a variety of courses including ones in computer science, engineering, and business. I recommend taking the Data Science MicroMasters program, which provides a comprehensive foundation of the field, including statistical and computational tools for data analysis.
Udacity, which is known for its nanodegree programs, offers practical, project-based tech learning experiences. Nanodegrees are certified online educational programs that teach you specialized skills in less time than traditional bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Consider the AI Programming With Python nanodegree, which covers the essential skills needed for building AI applications using programming languages such as Python, NumPy, and PyTorch.
Fast.ai offers free courses on deep learning. Start with the Practical Deep Learning for Coders program designed for beginners. It covers state-of-the-art techniques and tools.
Google’s free Machine Learning Crash Course provides a practical introduction to the topic using TensorFlow APIs, which are open-source machine learning libraries. The course includes exercises, interactive visualizations, and instructional videos.
